For the Egg drop problem:

> **_PROBLEM:_**  Suppose that you have an $n$-story building (with floors 1 through $n$) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor $T$ or 
> higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of  $T$ given the following limitations on the number of eggs and 
> tosses:
> * Version 0: 1 egg, $\leq T$ tosses.
> * Version 1: $\sim 1 \log(n)$ eggs and $\sim 1 \log(n)$ tosses.
> * Version 2: $\sim \log(T)$  eggs and $\sim 2 \log(T)$  tosses.
> * Version 3: 2 eggs and  $\sim 2\sqrt{n}$ tosses.
> * Version 4: 2 eggs and  $\leq c\sqrt{T}$  tosses for some fixed constant $c$.
